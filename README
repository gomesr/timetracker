Timetracker
-----------

A simple python utility that can be used to track what you're doing on your
computer at any moment. Was first written to track what I did on my gnome
desktop by recording the activities using the gnome time tracker applet (also
known as the hamster project). It can be easily extended to work on other 
desktop environments as well as other timetracking/notification systems.

Requirements
------------
  
   * Python 3 (no particular reason other than not wanting to have to rewrite 
               in the future when distros drop 2.x support)
               
   * hamster-applet latest build from master branch at 
   
     http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/building-and-running/ 

     Installing hamster:
     
        1. git clone git://git.gnome.org/hamster-applet
        2. cd hamster-applet
        3. ./waf configure build --prefix=/usr
        4. sudo ./waf install

Supported Environments
----------------------

Currently both KDE and Gnome desktops are supported but the tracking tool is the
same hamster time tracking application. On Gnome you can add the hamster-applet
to one of your panels but on KDE you'll have to startup the application 
"/usr/lib/hamster-applet/hamster-applet -w" background and then you can put that
window on your desktop and remove the borders and putting it in one of the 
desktop corners so you can check on it. You don't need to have the applet 
running for the timetracker to work correctly because it will still record
all of your activites to the hamster-service and you can check your statistics
by issuing "hamster-time-tracker" on the command line.

Installation
------------

Installing is currently done by just copy the src folder to a location of 
your choice followed by making sure that directory is your PATH.

Execution
---------

After checking out the tool it can easily be executed directly from the src 
directory. Before you execute you should copy the template configuration file
from timetracker.conf.template to ~/.timetracker.conf. Then you can execute 
and daemonize the timetracker utility by simply executing:

timetracker.py -d

A simple way to make sure your timertracker utility never stops running is to 
use the ps-watcher application to monitor and make sure it is always running. 
More information on the ps-watcher application can be found here:

   * http://ps-watcher.sourceforge.net/
   
A sample configuration entry for the timetracker application would be:

[timetracker]
occurs = none
action  = timetracker.py -d

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file for the timetracker utility is located at 
~/.timetracker.conf and has a few different options that you can set. The first
section is the "main" section which houses the configuration settings for the
currently used tracker and update interval. It also houses the exact location of
the output and error logs for timetracker. 

The "tags" section is where you can associate keywords with the tags that should
be recorded for that keyword. When you specify a keyword that word is compared 
in lowercase to the window title in lowercase. 

The "activities" section also matches keywords in lower case but in this case
its just choosing which activity name to associate with the currently focused
window.

The main reason to compare keywords in lowercase is that its fast and cheap. We
can easily support regular expressions in the future but for now this approach 
works fine.
