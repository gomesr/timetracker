timetracker
-----------

A simple python utility that can be used to track what you're doing on your
computer at any moment. Was first written to track what I did on my gnome
desktop by recording the activities using the gnome time tracker applet (also
known as the hamster project). It can be easily extended to work on other 
desktop environments as well as other timetracking/notification systems.

requirements
------------
  
   * Python 3 (no particular reason other than not wanting to have to rewrite 
               in the future when distros drop 2.x support)
               
   * hamster-applet latest build from master branch at http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/building-and-running/ 

execution
---------

After checking out the tool it can easily be executed directly from the src 
directory. Before you execute you should copy the template configuration file
from timetracker.conf.template to ~/.timetracker.conf

notes
-----

I used two different approaches to making the tracker and window manager plug-in 
architecture because I wanted to see an object oriented and non object oriented
method but also because they have slightly different requirements. While the 
tracker itself has a few more methods to implement and keep track of data. The
window manager only has to return the title of the currently active window and 
because of that just a simple required function to be created in the module is 
enough.
